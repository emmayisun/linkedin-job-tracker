2026-02-12 04:09 UTC,4365159462,AI Product Manager,Scale AI,San Francisco Bay Area (Hybrid),8+ years,"$237,600","Rating: High
Scale AI is a highly reputable leader in enterprise AI data solutions.

2026-02-12 04:16 UTC,4365221686,Senior Product Manager - Embedded Finance,Avalara,United States (Remote),6+ years,Not listed,"Rating: Medium

This is a medium match. The candidate offers exceptional AI/ML product experience and a strong track record of driving impact in enterprise and financial services. However, a significant gap exists in the core requirement for ""deep payment experience"" and ""embedded finance"" expertise; her background is in capital markets/trading, not payment processing infrastructure. Her total PM experience is also slightly below the stated 6+ years minimum.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4365221686/

While the candidate brings impressive AI Product Management expertise and experience in enterprise environments, this role heavily emphasizes *implementation project management* for existing enterprise software solutions. Her background focuses on product *development*, *strategy*, and *building* AI-powered platforms. Significant gaps include experience in client-facing software deployments, formal change management processes, PLM domain knowledge, and preferred project management certifications, making it a poor match for the described responsibilities.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4365103586/

Yi brings exceptional AI/LLM and platform-building expertise, ideal for a greenfield enterprise platform. Her strong technical background (MS CS, quantifiable impact) aligns well with the role's needs and ""nice to haves."" However, with ~5 years of PM experience, she falls short of the 7+ years required for a Principal role, and her shorter tenures might not demonstrate the ""long-term commitment"" sought.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4362118545/
