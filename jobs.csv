2026-02-12 04:16 UTC,4365221686,Senior Product Manager - Embedded Finance,Avalara,United States (Remote),6+ years,Not listed,"Rating: Medium

This is a medium match. The candidate offers exceptional AI/ML product experience and a strong track record of driving impact in enterprise and financial services. However, a significant gap exists in the core requirement for ""deep payment experience"" and ""embedded finance"" expertise; her background is in capital markets/trading, not payment processing infrastructure. Her total PM experience is also slightly below the stated 6+ years minimum.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4365221686/

While the candidate brings impressive AI Product Management expertise and experience in enterprise environments, this role heavily emphasizes *implementation project management* for existing enterprise software solutions. Her background focuses on product *development*, *strategy*, and *building* AI-powered platforms. Significant gaps include experience in client-facing software deployments, formal change management processes, PLM domain knowledge, and preferred project management certifications, making it a poor match for the described responsibilities.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4365103586/

Yi brings exceptional AI/LLM and platform-building expertise, ideal for a greenfield enterprise platform. Her strong technical background (MS CS, quantifiable impact) aligns well with the role's needs and ""nice to haves."" However, with ~5 years of PM experience, she falls short of the 7+ years required for a Principal role, and her shorter tenures might not demonstrate the ""long-term commitment"" sought.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4362118545/

Yi is an exceptional AI Product Manager with a strong record of driving impact. Their deep expertise in LLMs, ML pipelines, and strategic product development aligns perfectly with understanding the *needs* of AI applications. However, the role explicitly targets ""AI hardware in the datacom industry"" and ""high speed datacom and telecom solutions."" The candidate lacks direct experience in hardware product development or the specific datacom/telecom domain, which is a significant gap for this role at Molex.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4354191823/

This candidate is an exceptional match, particularly for the role's emphasis on AI's strategic implications on the Identity Security market. Yi brings deep AI/ML product strategy experience, proven analytical rigor, and a track record of significant business impact across complex enterprise environments. Their strong quantitative background and AI-focused education are perfectly aligned. While lacking direct identity security domain expertise and explicit people management experience (if implied by ""Group Manager""), their high-impact, data-driven approach and ability to collaborate with senior stakeholders make them a compelling candidate for driving next-generation product strategy.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4371696850/

Emma is an outstanding match. She possesses deep AI/ML expertise, specifically in fine-tuning LLMs, coupled with a robust track record of leveraging data and technology to achieve significant, quantifiable revenue and conversion uplifts across diverse industries. Her PM skills, A/B testing experience, and analytical prowess directly align with the CRO role's demands. The main gap is the potential seniority mismatch with an ""Associate"" title, and her short tenure at Commure warrants explanation.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4362561389/

Emma is an exceptional match. Her direct experience building and deploying AI agents and LLM-powered platforms for enterprises (Commure, ChatGeneT) with demonstrated business impact (revenue, churn reduction, scaling) aligns perfectly with Glean's ""build & ship production AI agents"" requirement. Her strong technical AI/ML skills and builder mentality fit the role's strategic and hands-on nature. The current MS CS (AI) enrollment might require clarification on availability, but her experience is highly relevant.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4362550865/

This candidate is a poor match. While technically strong with impressive AI/ML expertise and a track record of driving results, her ~5 years of experience is insufficient for a Principal Product Manager role, especially as she's currently a student. Her B2B/Enterprise AI background also lacks relevance to the core requirements of B2C fandom, social, and online community product management for ESPN. Key gaps include specific experience in fan engagement, brand safety, and operating online communities.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4370090117/

This candidate is an excellent match. Her deep AI/ML product leadership, coupled with a proven track record in driving revenue, conversions, and efficiency across complex platforms, aligns perfectly with the CRO Product Associate's mandate, especially the explicit AI focus for optimization. Key strengths include quantifiable business impact from AI initiatives and robust analytical skills. While her industry background isn't home improvement, her transferable skills are extremely strong. The ""Associate"" title might be slightly junior for her experience, but her AI expertise is a strong fit.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4362511616/

This candidate brings exceptional AI/LLM product expertise, having fine-tuned models, built AI pipelines, and driven significant revenue and efficiency gains at scale. Their technical background (MS CS AI) is a strong match for Vercel's AI-native mission. However, they barely meet the 5+ years PM experience, and a notable gap exists in explicit experience with developer tools, the frontend ecosystem, and directly managing a PM team, which are crucial for this Product Lead role at Vercel. Their recent short tenure at Commure is also a potential concern.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4365118817/

This is an excellent match. The candidate offers deep expertise in AI/ML strategy, LLM fine-tuning, and building impactful AI platforms, directly aligning with the role's focus on member understanding and intelligence. Their experience leading strategic initiatives, driving significant revenue/churn improvements, and prior work in the healthcare domain are major strengths. While specific B2C wearable personalization experience isn't explicit, their strong AI foundation, strategic acumen, and results-driven approach make them a top contender.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4354262823/

Yi ""Emma"" Sun offers exceptional AI/ML product leadership, demonstrating a strong track record fine-tuning LLMs, building AI pipelines, and achieving significant business impact. Her technical depth and experience scaling enterprise platforms are highly relevant to Shield AI's mission autonomy solutions. However, a critical gap is the complete absence of domain expertise in defense, rotorcraft, logistics, or robotics hardware, which the ""Senior Staff"" role explicitly requires. The candidate also might be slightly junior in overall PM years for a ""Staff"" level.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4343122121/

The candidate is an exceptional technical match, bringing deep AI/LLM product expertise, including fine-tuning, pipeline building, and enterprise platform experience with quantifiable impact. Their end-to-end ownership and strong technical background (CS MS, Math Finance) perfectly align with the 0->1 AI startup needs. Key strengths: direct LLM/AI experience, strong metrics, product ownership. Gaps: Lack of logistics domain knowledge and the ongoing MS (Sep 2024-Dec 2025) presents a significant practical conflict for a full-time Founding Product Manager role. Short tenure at Commure is a minor flag.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4371892183/

This is a strong match. Emma possesses deep AI/LLM expertise, a track record of scaling enterprise products, and quantifiable impact across healthcare and finance. Her experience in fine-tuning LLMs, driving revenue, and managing complex AI deployments directly aligns with Anthropic's mission and product needs. While her experience is primarily as a Product Manager, she has extensively performed the *functions* of Product Operations, such as establishing metrics, improving workflows, and enabling product adoption (e.g., ChatGeneT deployment). The main gap is explicit public sector experience, though healthcare is a good proxy, and her resume doesn't explicitly detail building product *operations systems* for other teams, rather than executing product development with operational rigor.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4323262072/
2026-02-12 14:45 UTC,4309206886,"Sr. Product Manager, Compute Platform",Databricks,"San Francisco, CA",5+ years,"$153,000","Rating: Medium

Yi has strong AI/ML product management experience, a relevant MS CS degree, and a proven track record of shipping impactful enterprise AI products. She meets the 5+ years PM experience. However, her background lacks explicit experience in building or managing cloud/data *compute infrastructure* (e.g., serverless, SQL warehouses), which is core to this role.

Analysis:
The candidate is a strong Product Manager with impressive AI/ML expertise and a track record of driving significant business impact across enterprise platforms in finance and healthcare. However, this role is highly specific to Workday Recruiting. The candidate's resume shows no direct experience with Workday or the HR/Talent Acquisition domain, which is a critical requirement for a Senior Product Manager responsible for bridging talent strategy and technical implementation within Workday's ATS.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4339766200/

This candidate is significantly overqualified as a Product Manager with strong AI/ML expertise, but lacks direct relevance to this NPI Project Coordinator role. Their experience is entirely software/AI-focused, with no mention of hardware NPI, PCBA builds, DFX, or manufacturing coordination. While they demonstrate an execution mindset and KPI tracking, the domain and career level are a poor fit for the listed salary and specific responsibilities.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4363972527/
