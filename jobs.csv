2026-02-12 04:09 UTC,4365159462,AI Product Manager,Scale AI,San Francisco Bay Area (Hybrid),8+ years,"$237,600","Rating: High
Scale AI is a highly reputable leader in enterprise AI data solutions. This role is strongly aligned with enterprise AI product management, involving direct collaboration with ""biggest customers"" and their researchers to drive AI model development and influence external roadmaps.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4365159462/
2026-02-12 04:16 UTC,4365221686,Senior Product Manager - Embedded Finance,Avalara,United States (Remote),6+ years,Not listed,"Rating: Medium

This is a medium match. The candidate offers exceptional AI/ML product experience and a strong track record of driving impact in enterprise and financial services. However, a significant gap exists in the core requirement for ""deep payment experience"" and ""embedded finance"" expertise; her background is in capital markets/trading, not payment processing infrastructure. Her total PM experience is also slightly below the stated 6+ years minimum.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4365221686/
2026-02-12 04:16 UTC,4365103586,Sr. Product Manager,Centric Software,"Campbell, CA",Not specified,$130K/yr - $160K/yr,"Rating: Low

While the candidate brings impressive AI Product Management expertise and experience in enterprise environments, this role heavily emphasizes *implementation project management* for existing enterprise software solutions. Her background focuses on product *development*, *strategy*, and *building* AI-powered platforms. Significant gaps include experience in client-facing software deployments, formal change management processes, PLM domain knowledge, and preferred project management certifications, making it a poor match for the described responsibilities.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4365103586/
2026-02-12 04:16 UTC,4362118545,Principal Product Manager - New Markets Platform,Veeva Systems,United States (Remote),7+ years,$150K/yr - $275K/yr,"Rating: Medium

Yi brings exceptional AI/LLM and platform-building expertise, ideal for a greenfield enterprise platform. Her strong technical background (MS CS, quantifiable impact) aligns well with the role's needs and ""nice to haves."" However, with ~5 years of PM experience, she falls short of the 7+ years required for a Principal role, and her shorter tenures might not demonstrate the ""long-term commitment"" sought.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4362118545/
2026-02-12 06:07 UTC,4354191823,New Product Development Manager,Molex,"Fremont, CA (On-site)",4+ years,$130K/yr - $160K/yr,"Rating: Medium

Yi is an exceptional AI Product Manager with a strong record of driving impact. Their deep expertise in LLMs, ML pipelines, and strategic product development aligns perfectly with understanding the *needs* of AI applications. However, the role explicitly targets ""AI hardware in the datacom industry"" and ""high speed datacom and telecom solutions."" The candidate lacks direct experience in hardware product development or the specific datacom/telecom domain, which is a significant gap for this role at Molex.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4354191823/
2026-02-12 06:07 UTC,4371696850,Group Manager of Strategy & Analytics - Product Strategy,Okta,"San Francisco, CA (Hybrid)",8+ years,"$193,000","Rating: High

This candidate is an exceptional match, particularly for the role's emphasis on AI's strategic implications on the Identity Security market. Yi brings deep AI/ML product strategy experience, proven analytical rigor, and a track record of significant business impact across complex enterprise environments. Their strong quantitative background and AI-focused education are perfectly aligned. While lacking direct identity security domain expertise and explicit people management experience (if implied by ""Group Manager""), their high-impact, data-driven approach and ability to collaborate with senior stakeholders make them a compelling candidate for driving next-generation product strategy.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4371696850/
2026-02-12 06:07 UTC,4362561389,CRO Product Associate,QuinStreet,United States (Remote),1+ years,$65K/yr - $75K/yr,"Rating: High

Emma is an outstanding match. She possesses deep AI/ML expertise, specifically in fine-tuning LLMs, coupled with a robust track record of leveraging data and technology to achieve significant, quantifiable revenue and conversion uplifts across diverse industries. Her PM skills, A/B testing experience, and analytical prowess directly align with the CRO role's demands. The main gap is the potential seniority mismatch with an ""Associate"" title, and her short tenure at Commure warrants explanation.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4362561389/

Emma is an exceptional match. Her direct experience building and deploying AI agents and LLM-powered platforms for enterprises (Commure, ChatGeneT) with demonstrated business impact (revenue, churn reduction, scaling) aligns perfectly with Glean's ""build & ship production AI agents"" requirement. Her strong technical AI/ML skills and builder mentality fit the role's strategic and hands-on nature. The current MS CS (AI) enrollment might require clarification on availability, but her experience is highly relevant.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4362550865/

This candidate is a poor match. While technically strong with impressive AI/ML expertise and a track record of driving results, her ~5 years of experience is insufficient for a Principal Product Manager role, especially as she's currently a student. Her B2B/Enterprise AI background also lacks relevance to the core requirements of B2C fandom, social, and online community product management for ESPN. Key gaps include specific experience in fan engagement, brand safety, and operating online communities.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4370090117/
2026-02-12 06:07 UTC,4362511616,CRO Product Associate,Modernize,United States (Remote),1+ years,$65K/yr - $75K/yr,"Rating: High

This candidate is an excellent match. Her deep AI/ML product leadership, coupled with a proven track record in driving revenue, conversions, and efficiency across complex platforms, aligns perfectly with the CRO Product Associate's mandate, especially the explicit AI focus for optimization. Key strengths include quantifiable business impact from AI initiatives and robust analytical skills. While her industry background isn't home improvement, her transferable skills are extremely strong. The ""Associate"" title might be slightly junior for her experience, but her AI expertise is a strong fit.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4362511616/

This candidate brings exceptional AI/LLM product expertise, having fine-tuned models, built AI pipelines, and driven significant revenue and efficiency gains at scale. Their technical background (MS CS AI) is a strong match for Vercel's AI-native mission. However, they barely meet the 5+ years PM experience, and a notable gap exists in explicit experience with developer tools, the frontend ecosystem, and directly managing a PM team, which are crucial for this Product Lead role at Vercel. Their recent short tenure at Commure is also a potential concern.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4365118817/
